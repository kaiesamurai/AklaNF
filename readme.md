"AklaNF - Strengthening Avalanche Validator Network through RediYeti-Inspired Delegation Guarantor"

# AklaNF

## Introduction
AklaNF is a project aimed at fortifying the Avalanche validator network by incentivizing wider distribution of nodes. Inspired by RediYeti's mission, AklaNF endeavors to encourage AVAX holders to delegate their tokens to validator nodes, promoting decentralization while ensuring staking rewards regardless of uptime.

## What it Does
AklaNF offers a delegation guarantor system for Avalanche validator node operators, assuring delegators of staking rewards irrespective of node uptime. By fostering delegation to more distributed nodes, AklaNF enhances network resilience and decentralization, making nodes with lower uptime equally attractive to potential delegators.

## Development Approach
Under active development, AklaNF utilizes the Chainlink hackathon as a starting point. The project commenced with the creation of a Chainlink adapter to facilitate communication between the Avalanche P-chain and C-chain. Additionally, AklaNF encompasses a web application, a series of solidity smart contracts, and a module for automatic engagement of smart contracts with new delegators. Development technologies include Vue, Vuetify, Golang, and Avalanche-specific tools.

## Branding and Identity
AklaNF prioritizes strong branding, featuring a mascot, the Redi Yeti, representing the project's commitment to safeguarding AVAX. The branding aligns with the snow-themed identity of Avalanche, enhancing the project's visibility and recognition.

## Challenges Faced
A significant challenge encountered during development was the scarcity of documentation for both Avalanche and Chainlink. Despite commendable efforts by both platforms, robust documentation is essential for community building and developer support. Overcoming this challenge required extensive research and reliance on available resources, including tutorial videos.

## Accomplishments
AklaNF celebrates its achievement in mastering both Avalanche and Chainlink platforms, recognizing their significance for the future. The project takes pride in its evolving brand identity and the successful integration of disparate elements into a cohesive product poised to strengthen the Avalanche network.

## Lessons Learned
AklaNF acknowledges the invaluable lessons learned throughout the development process. One notable lesson involved the discovery of associated addresses between the P-chain and X-chain, enabling accurate payout distribution. Such practical insights underscore the importance of hands-on experience in navigating complex blockchain ecosystems.

## Future Endeavors
With approximately six weeks of development and testing remaining, AklaNF anticipates going live soon. The project looks forward to integrating with the Avalanche-Chainlink connector, positioning itself as an early adopter of this pivotal integration.
